  a data logger to capture strawberry data in a mobile application that stores the data in a local database. The app has fields to record data for each of five different strawberry varieties to be investigated. If a strawberry type is selected, a page (fragment) is shown to add data entries for that strawberry type. An entry consists of strawberry data. When the Save Log Entry button is pressed these values are saved locally in the application in a SQLDatabase. When the Show Log Entries button is pressed a related page (fragment) is shown that list all the date/time and strawberry entries made for that strawberry. When the Send all entries item in the profile menu is selected, the data from the SQLDatabase database is composed into an email, and sent using the built in mail app. The SQLDatabase database is then
cleared of all entries. Appropriate messages are to be sent during this interaction.
